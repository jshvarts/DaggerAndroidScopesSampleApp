/**
 * A {@link BaseFragment} that contains and invokes {@link Presenter} lifecycle invocations.
 *
 * The BaseViewFragment is a subclass of our view.BaseFragment and implements the MVPView interface.
 * It contains a type T that extends a Presenter. The T presenter is injected here so that its lifecycle methods can be invoked.
 * This gives subclasses the T presenter for free and not have to worry about invoking the Presenterâ€™s lifecycle methods.
 *
 * Question: Why are there 2 different base fragment classes; BaseFragment and BaseViewFragment?
 * Why not just combine them into 1 base class?
 *
 * Some Fragments, such as our MainFragment, do not contain any logic to warrant a need for a Presenter.
 * Logic-free Fragments extend the BaseFragment since they do not need to have a Presenter-View pair.
 * For Fragments that do have logic and need a Presenter to host said logic, the BaseViewFragment is used.
 *
 * @param <T> the type of the {@link Presenter}.
